This Google Maps wrapper demo does two things:

- Clicking on a cityname will highlight the cityname, set the marker and pan the map to that location
- Panning the map will highlight the name of the city which is nearest the map's center

To stand the app up on a local machine:

- Clone it
- `npm install`
- Get a Google Maps key and replace my key value in Map.js with your own.
- `npm run start`

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app, which was subsequently ejected.

This is not a responsive app.  It's best viewed on a desktop.
